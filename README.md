# ml-journey

### Introduction
This repository is used to track experiments in my personal journey into machine learning. Most of the code is taken from other places with modifications done by me while trying different things and playing around. I am motivated in using Machine Learning for purposes aligned with my personal values. I am very interested in the medical and fighting climate change applications. On the other hand, I am not interested at all in applications related to personalized advertising or public opinion manipulation. If you have similar interests please do not hesitate in reaching out.  
Please feel free to use any code published in this repo bearing in mind that most code is experimental and not up to production-level standards. You may want to improve the documentation and readability if using some snippet of code on your own application. If you find some code is referenced to another source please check with the corresponding author if the licensing allows the type of usage you are pursuing.

### Index
* [Transfer learning tutorials](https://github.com/lddm/ml-journey/tree/main/transfer_learning)
* [Stanford CS231n course assignments](https://github.com/lddm/ml-journey/tree/main/cs231n): I found in the first assignments an amazing hands-on experience on the very basics of neural networks and back-propagation. When the assignments moved into training deep neural networks I decided to directly move to real-world applications.


#### Disclaimer
I will try my best to keep acknowledgments to corresponding authors whenever possible. If you find some content that is identical to another source and it's missing the corresponding reference please do not assume bad intention on my part. I'm not trying to take ownership of other people work, most surely I missed adding the reference unintentionally :-)
