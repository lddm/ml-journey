### Introduction
This repository is used to track experiments in my personal journey into machine learning. Most of the code is taken from other places with modifications done by me while trying different things and playing around. I will try my best to keep acknowledgments to corresponding authors whenever possible. If you find some content that is identical to another source and it's missing the corresponding reference please do not assume bad intention on my part. I'm not trying to take ownership of other people work, most surely I missed adding the reference unintentionally :-)
